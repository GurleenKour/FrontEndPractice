<!-- i have practiced responsiveness of web design -->
<!-- fixed moves the element in context of viewport and are taken out of documrnt flow and have z-index of zero -->
<!-- absolute takes the element out of document flow , in context of html , IF parent have a property (other than sticky) ,then , ele,ent moves in context of parent-->
<!-- relative moves in context of its previous position -->
<!-- sticky normally behaves as rerlatiive , but with distance applied it acts as sticky, once margin of viewport is it , and continue to act like the same until the content of parent finishes -->

<!-- for z-index the order is the document flow  order of siblings -->
